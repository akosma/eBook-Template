= Template for Writing an eBook

This is a new version of the classic template for eBooks.

== Design Guidelines

Why using such a complex setup instead of just using a simpler tool like Word or
Pages?

- The primary motivation of this template is versioning. Being able to use plain
  text files as input for the book brings the possibility of versioning each
  change individually using Git, Subversion or any other similar tool. This also
  opens up the door to collaboration among team members when editing a document.
- The second motivation is to separate the presentation and the layout of the
  final book from its contents. Other output file types could be added in the
  future.
- This also brings the possibility of using any text editor in just about any
  operating system; files are just plain text files that can be edited with
  gEdit, Notepad, Emacs, Vim, TextEdit, or any other similar tool.
- Markup languages like Markdown or Asciidoc (used in this template) are simpler
  and more readable than LaTeX or other SGML-like languages, making the files
  readable and lean even when edited in a text editor without any syntax
  highlighting or formatting support.
- Finally, being able to streamline the creation of the three versions of the
  book in just one command-line operation allows the whole setup to be
  automatized.

The choice of http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] comes from the following
features:

- Syntax highlighting of https://swift.org[Swift] code in all outputs
  (http://pandoc.org[Pandoc] does not support Swift at the moment.)
- Multi-file projects (Pandoc, because of Markdown, does not support the
  `include` mechanism that AsciiDoc provides.)

== History

This toolkit started as a pure LaTeX workflow in 2009. In late 2011 the system
moved to Markdown and it used Pandoc to generate the artifacts. In 2012 the
choice was http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc], and in 2016 this new system was
finally developed, using AsciiDoctor.

== How To Use

The `master.asciidoc` file at the root of this project provides the guiding
structure of the book. Chapters can be shuffled around, independently of their
contents or internal structure.

Individual chapters are stored in the `chapters` folder, one file per chapter.

Images are stored as PNG files in the `images` folder. Data files (XML, CSV,
etc,) are located in the `data` folder.

The Makefile creates a temporary `_build` folder, copies all the different
elements in it (the master file, the chapters and the images) and commands the
execution of the whole toolchain in order to get the final result:

- Self-contained HTML5
- PDF
- EPUB3
- Kindle (.mobi)

UML diagrams are generated by text through http://plantuml.com[PlantUML].

1. Execute the `make` command. This will create the PDF, ePub and HTML
   versions of the book.
2. `make pdf`, `make html`, `make epub` and `make kindle` each generate
   the specified version of the booklet.
3. `make clean` removes the `_build` folder.

After the build process completes, the compiled eBooks will be available
at the `_build` subfolder.

== Requirements and Installation Instructions

=== macOS (Sierra)

Before using this template, make sure to have Homebrew and Rubygems installed,
then run the following commands to install the required dependencies:

    $ xcode-select --install # (required for nokogiri, itself a requirement for asciidoc-epub3)
    $ brew install plantuml glib gdk-pixbuf cairo pango cmake libxml2
    $ gem install pygments.rb kindlegen asciimath asciidoctor asciidoctor-diagram asciidoctor-mathematical
    $ gem install asciidoctor-pdf asciidoctor-epub3 --pre

Install the font dependencies for `asciidoctor-mathematical`:

    cd ~/Library/Fonts; \
    curl -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmex10.ttf \
         -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmmi10.ttf \
         -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmr10.ttf \
         -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmsy10.ttf \
         -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/esint10.ttf \
         -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/eufm10.ttf \
         -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/msam10.ttf \
         -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/msbm10.ttf

If you experience compilation problems with `asciidoctor-mathematical` you can
`brew link gettext --force` if needed. Follow the installation instructions from
the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-mathematical[project] in case of
issues.

=== Ubuntu Linux (16.04/16.10)

Install the following libraries:

    sudo apt-get install -y plantuml cmake ruby-dev libxml2-dev libcairo2-dev \
        libpango1.0-dev bison flex libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libffi-dev ttf-lyx \
        intltool
    sudo gem install pygments.rb kindlegen asciimath asciidoctor \
        asciidoctor-diagram
    sudo gem install asciidoctor-pdf asciidoctor-epub3 --pre
    sudo MATHEMATICAL_SKIP_STRDUP=1 gem install mathematical
    sudo gem install asciidoctor-mathematical

The libraries used in this template require `liblasem` which might not be
available in your distribution. You should install it manually (well, at
least I had to) this is how to do this:

    wget http://ie.archive.ubuntu.com/gnome/sources/lasem/0.5/lasem-0.5.0.tar.xz
    tar xf lasem-0.5.0.tar.xz
    pushd lasem-0.5.0
    ./configure && make && sudo make install
    popd
